		<p class="ptag">So you've decided to get involved in making a Basic Income a reality in Australia... what now?</p>
		<p class="ptag">The first thing to keep in mind is that the Basic Income movement can never grow if new people don't join in, so your ideas, opinions and contributions are essential to achieving this goal.</p>
		<p class="ptag">Now in order to find the most effective fit for you in the group we need to know a few things about you (all responses here can be updated later via your account profile)...</p>
		<h5>??as they update the values on the page it should periodically send the data off to the server, so that if something goes wrong we've still got partial data</h5>
		<form>
			<label>Why are you passionate about a Basic Income?</label>
			<label>What do you think are your greatest skills/contributions? (either select from existing skills or submit something new. Highlighted traits are identified by the group as being in high demand)</label>
			<label>Do you already have any ideas for steps towards achieving a Basic Income in Australia? (A good way to tell if you do is if you think to yourself "how come they're not doing X")</label>
			<label>How often can the group contact you regarding your skills? (this field only relates to your skills so we can reach out if we're working on something relating to your area of specialty. Notifications for events can be configured separately</label>
			<label>What is your preferred contact method/account name?</label>
			<p>Finally, a few questions to help the marketing of the group:</p>
			<label>Would you consent to your name being on a list of group members?</label>
			<label>How did you hear about the group?</label>
			<label>How often would you like the group to notify you about upcoming events, and other sigificant group news items?</label>
		</form>
		<p class="ptag" style="display: none;">Thanks for letting us know about you! Now the next step if you haven't already is to see what events are taking place near you (?LINK HERE) Are these events inaccessible to you? Tell us why (?LINK HERE)</p>
